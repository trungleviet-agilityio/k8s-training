# Kubernetes Learning Repository

This repository contains my step-by-step Kubernetes learning journey.

## Structure

- **docs/** — learning plan, daily notes, diagrams  
- **exercises/** — topic-based Kubernetes manifests  
- **practice/** — larger practice projects (local → CKAD → EKS)  
- **.github/workflows/** — automation (YAML validation)  

I follow a milestone-based learning flow:
- M1 – Kubernetes Fundamentals (Local Cluster)
- M2 – CKAD Skills
- M3 – AWS EKS Fundamentals
- M4 – CI/CD for Kubernetes
- M5 – Practice Project (Final)

Each folder contains manifests or code created as part of completing the milestone issues.
