# Kubernetes Learning Repo

This repository tracks my Kubernetes learning journey:

- **docs/** – training plan, notes, and diagrams
- **exercises/** – topic-based YAML manifests (pods, deployments, services, etc.)
- **practice/** – larger practice projects (local cluster, CKAD-style labs, EKS)
- **.github/workflows/** – automation (YAML validation, etc.)

I’ll treat this repo like a real project: branches, pull requests, issues, and milestones.
